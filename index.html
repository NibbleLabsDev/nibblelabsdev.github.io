      <p>
        Nibble Labs is a software studio focused on building and testing small,
        well-defined solutions to everyday operational problems.
        We work in short cycles — identify friction, automate what matters,
        and validate ideas through real-world use.

      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Lightweight workflow and reporting automation</li>
        <li>Data cleanup, integration, and transformation</li>
        <li>Rapid pilots to validate software ideas</li>

      <h2>How We Work</h2>
      <p>
        We believe in starting small. Rather than large upfront builds,
        we focus on fast experiments, close feedback, and incremental improvement.
        If something works, we double down. If it doesn’t, we learn and move on.

      <h2>Get in Touch</h2>
      <p>
        If you’re dealing with a recurring manual process or exploring an idea
        that could benefit from automation, we’d love to talk.
